## Resource Management of Leap

Leap provides a **fully managed resource management architecture** consisting of:
1. **Memory Resources**: For fast responses to high volumes of requests, ideal for real-time services like OTT or video streaming.
2. **File System Resources**: Used for handling large data that doesn't require rapid response times.

### Key Highlights:
- Splitting large resources into smaller parts using **disassemble-assemble mechanisms** ensures fast and stable delivery.
- **Administrator filters** for securing and managing resources effectively.
- **Dynamic resource request handling**: Users can access resources by requesting a URL.
