                Leap has fully-managed resource management architecture. It's divided into two different methodical part for resource service which is consisted with memory resources and file system resources.
                <br>
                Memory resources contributes with processing more faster response for huge amount of request and file resources is used for big size data response or non-critical on fast response as well.
                If a system has plenty of memory resource, It can serve for On-demand contents service and realtime streaming service like OTT or video streaming platform etc.
                <br>
                May if a system has a plenty of memory, In-memory resource can be having huge size of data. As a matter of fact, memory resource absolutely could provide more faster than file system.
                <br>
                Because of managing resources with splited part size using disassemble-assemble machanism, single huge resource can be loaded to memory.
                <br>
                It is able to let the server can provide single huge file to client more fast and stable. Also resource manager has proper filters to manage resources to secure and ensure.
                <br>
                Administrator can register filters in configuration of Leap for allowed resources and forbidden resources to be more secure and ensure to managed resource.
                <br>
                Resource manager provides various functionalities for supporting to combine between requested context and real resources and client can be took resources by just requesting URL on browser or others.
